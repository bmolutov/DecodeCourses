Just solve the following problems yourself:

1) Read n number of integers. Print all of the by the following format (hint: us printf or format() method) (let arr is our array of integers):
    [Previous and next numbers for arr[i] are (arr[i] - 1) and (arr[i] + 1) respectively]
    [Previous and next numbers for arr[i+1] are (arr[i+1] - 1) and (arr[i+1] + 1) respectively]
    ...
    [Previous and next numbers for arr[n-1] are (arr[n-1] - 1) and (arr[n-1] + 1) respectively]

2) Read an integer and print sum of its digits.
3) Read an integer. Print its reversed and then doubled value.
4) Read an integer. Print all divisors of this number in any format you want.
5) Read the input of integer until you get zero. If you get zero stop the process and print sum of the integers that you've read.
