Just solve the following problems yourself:

1) Create a class with 3 attributes of different types. 
And also create a second class in which you will use the 
fields of the first. (print to console)

2) Create a class with 3 attributes of different types. 
And also another class in which there will be one static method, 
this method will simply display what is passed as arguments when called. 
Call this method and show me the output.

3) Create a class with a non-static method that takes just one 
argument of type String and prints it out. Create a second class with 
a static method that takes two int type arguments and returns their sum, 
and before returning the sum inside this method, the first class method 
is called to which the string "Calculator" is passed. A static 
method must be called on the class it belongs to.

4) Create a class that describes a person. Let this class have 
at least 5 attributes and 4 methods.
