Just solve the following problems yourself:

1) Implement class Rectangle with the following methods:
	getSquare() - returns value of square of the rectangle
	getWidth() - returns width of the rectangle
	setWidth(int width) - sets the value of width
	getHeight() - return height of the rectangle
	setHeight(int height) - sets the value of height

2) Create class named Cat with any attributes, but the way that the following methods will be usable:
	setName(String name) - give the game for cat
	getName() - get the name of cat
	run() - decreases amount of energy by 100
	getEnergy() - returns the current amount of energy. Initial value of energy is 1000
	eat() - increases amount of energy by 200
	sleep() - increases amount of energy by 100

3) Create class Stack. Fot this class should be available the following methods:
	push(int value) - put number into the Stack
	pop() - return the last(top) element of stack and remove it, in case of retrieving maximum or minimum 
			you should find updated(new) maximum and minimum
	getMin() - returns the minimum value from stack	
	getMax() - returns the maximum value from stack
	size() - returns size of the stack
	isEmpty() - checks if whether the stack is empty or not

4) Create class Circle, in it you should Implement methods for computing square and perimeter of circle.
	Let pi = 3.14.

5) Create a class Animal (parent of all animals). Animal class has two children: WildAnimal and HomeAnimal.
	Class WildAnimal has two children: WaterAnimal and ForestAnimal. Class HomeAnimal has two children:
	Pets and Livestock. And then create classes Cow and Wolf. All the classes except Cow and Wold should be 
	abstract. Important note: you can leave all classes without attributes and methods.
