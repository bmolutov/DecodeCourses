Chats and Privacy Mode 

If 'Privacy mode' of your bot is enabled it won't be able to receive messages of group members.
Instead, it will get:
    -> Messages that begin with '/'
    -> Replies to bot's messages
    -> Service messages
    -> Messages from channels where bot is member

If 'Privacy mode' is disabled above restrictions will off
We can manage it by calling @botfather
